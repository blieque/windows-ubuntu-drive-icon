**** Ubuntu Drive Icon for Windows

I frequently use both Windows and Ubuntu, to the degree that I wouldn’t feel comfortable uninstalling either. By use of Ext2FSD in Windows, I am able to mount (as U:\) and browse my Ubuntu partition, despite it being an Ext2 Linux filesystem.

After a while, I’d had enough of the plain drive icon (shown for my “Media” drive) being used for the Ubuntu partition. I extracted the default icons from Windows’ imageres.dll, and then used Photoshop and Illustrator to create a similarly styled drive icon for Ubuntu.

The download below contains all ten sizes included, and the single compilation icon file. It also contains instructions for installation, and a small application to install or uninstall the icon automatically.
