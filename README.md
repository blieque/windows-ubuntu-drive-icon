# Ubuntu Drive Icon for Windows

I frequently use both Windows and Ubuntu, to the degree that I wouldn’t feel comfortable uninstalling either. By use of Ext2FSD in Windows, I am able to mount (as U:\) and browse my Ubuntu partition, despite it being an Ext2 Linux filesystem.

After a while, I’d had enough of the plain drive icon (shown for my “Media” drive) being used for the Ubuntu partition. I extracted the default icons from Windows’ imageres.dll, and then used Photoshop and Illustrator to create a similarly styled drive icon for Ubuntu.

The download below contains all ten sizes included, and the single compilation icon file. It also contains instructions for installation, and a small application to install or uninstall the icon automatically.

## Why is the C++ discontinued?

I was having serious difficulties with C++. Right from the start I knew it would be possible, and probably easier, to make what I wanted with Batch, but chose C++ to challenge myself. I guess I bit off more than I could realistically chew, or C++ and the Windows API in particular are both just a nightmare. I may come back to this one day but for now, Batch provided the solution, and in just 20 lines.
